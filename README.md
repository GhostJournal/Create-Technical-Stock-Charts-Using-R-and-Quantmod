In a video that plays in a split-screen with your work area, your instructor will walk you through these steps:

    Task 1: In this Task the Learner will pull down data from Yahoo using Quantmod's 'getsymbols' function.  

    Task 2:  In this task the Learner will get familiar with the basic syntax in order to build basic graphs (i.e., Candlestick, Line, Bar, etc).  

    Task 3: A Bollinger Band is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of lines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a simple moving average (SMA).   In this Task the Learner will apply the Bollinger Band technical indicator.

    Task 4: The Learner will apply a technical trading indicator called thh relative strength index (RSI).  RSI is a technical indicator used in stock analysis and is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. 
     

    Task 5:  In this Task the Learner will apply the exponential moving average using a built in quantmod function.
